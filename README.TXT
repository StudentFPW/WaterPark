RECOMMENDATION: ←
    Do not touch this file = rotation_software.py
    If there are fewer names in the file with worker names than the position of the slide, the program will give an ERROR
    Don't move files to another directory
    Put worker names letter up (not important, but easy to read for you)
    All names of workers must be different
    Do not change file name
    For any error, call the developer (+37127458854 : Leo)
